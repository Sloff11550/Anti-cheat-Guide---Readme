[‚ö†Ô∏è Suspicious Content] üß† What is Kernel-Level Anti-Cheat? ‚Äî Explained

This document is a comprehensive breakdown of kernel-level anti-cheat technology: what it is, how it works, what it‚Äôs capable of doing, and why it's controversial in the gaming and privacy communities.

üîç What is Kernel-Level Anti-Cheat?

Kernel-level anti-cheat refers to a type of software that operates with the highest level of system access ‚Äî the kernel of your operating system (Ring 0). This is the same level used by your OS itself and core system drivers.

Unlike traditional anti-cheat tools that run in user mode (Ring 3), kernel-mode anti-cheats can:

Monitor everything happening on the system.

Access memory, processes, input devices, and hardware directly.

Intercept or block system-level operations before they even reach the game.

In short: It runs deeper than antivirus software.

üß± Why Do Developers Use It?

Game developers argue that kernel-level anti-cheat is necessary because:

Cheaters increasingly use kernel-mode cheats that can hide from standard detection.

User-mode anti-cheat solutions can be bypassed or manipulated more easily.

Faster detection and prevention of suspicious behavior before it affects online gameplay.

Games like Valorant, Call of Duty, Rainbow Six Siege, and PUBG have adopted this model.

üö® What is It Capable Of?

When installed, kernel-level anti-cheat drivers can:

Read/write to system memory at any time.

Monitor what software you run, including background apps.

Track connected devices (USB, input, etc.).

Log system events or crash data.

Potentially intercept keystrokes, mouse inputs, or file access.

Load at system boot and persist even when the game is not running.

Some systems (like Riot‚Äôs Vanguard) remain active 100% of the time, even when Valorant isn‚Äôt open.

‚öñÔ∏è Why It's Controversial

Privacy Risks: Kernel access gives anti-cheat software the ability to spy on your entire system.

Security Concerns: A bug or exploit in anti-cheat code could give malicious actors full access to your computer.

No Transparency: Most anti-cheats are closed-source, with no clear audit of what they actually do.

Persistence: Many services remain running even after uninstalling the game.

False Flags: Legit tools (like mods or overlays) may be wrongly detected and result in bans.

üõ°Ô∏è How Can You Protect Yourself?

Be selective about which games you install, especially those requiring boot-level anti-cheats.

Use system monitoring tools (like Process Explorer, Autoruns) to check what‚Äôs running.

Consider using a second ‚Äúgaming-only‚Äù PC or partition if you want full separation.

Advocate for transparency from developers ‚Äî demand opt-in options and public audits.

üì¢ Final Thoughts

Kernel-level anti-cheat software is powerful. While it may reduce cheating, it does so by sacrificing user control and trust. Awareness and caution are essential ‚Äî players should always know what‚Äôs being installed and what level of access it grants.

üß† TL;DR ‚Äî For Normal Humans

This stuff runs deeper than antivirus software. It has full control of your PC.

It can keep running even when you're not playing the game.

It can see everything: your files, your programs, your USB devices, and more.

If it gets hacked or makes a mistake, your entire computer could be at risk.

It doesn‚Äôt ask permission ‚Äî it just installs.

If someone told you a game needed full admin access to your PC 24/7, you'd say ‚Äúhell no.‚Äù That‚Äôs what kernel-level anti-cheat does ‚Äî just without asking nicely.

Be smart. Be safe. Know what you're installing.

üéØ What This Covers

Disabling/removing kernel-level anti-cheats like:

Riot Vanguard (vgk, vgc)

Easy Anti-Cheat (EasyAntiCheat)

BattlEye (BEService)

RICOCHET (atvi-brynhildr)

FACEIT Anti-Cheat (FACEIT)

XIGNCODE3 (xhunter1)

nProtect GameGuard (npggsvc)

‚ö° Scripts Included

‚úÖ Universal Kill Switch (Temporarily Stop All)

Stops all known anti-cheat services:

$services = @("vgk","vgc","EasyAntiCheat","BEService","atvi-brynhildr","FACEIT","xhunter1","npggsvc")
foreach ($svc in $services) { sc.exe stop $svc 2>$null }

üîç Status Scanner (Check What‚Äôs Running)

Shows which services are running, installed, or not present:

foreach ($svc in $services) {
  $status = Get-Service -Name $svc -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
  if ($status -and $status.Status -eq 'Running') {
    Write-Host "$svc is RUNNING" -ForegroundColor Red
  } elseif ($status) {
    Write-Host "$svc is installed but NOT running" -ForegroundColor Yellow
  } else {
    Write-Host "$svc is NOT installed" -ForegroundColor Green
  }
}

üîí Disable on Boot

Prevents all known anti-cheat services from starting automatically:

foreach ($svc in $services) {
  Set-Service -Name $svc -StartupType Disabled -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
}

‚úÖ Additional Notes

These scripts must be run as Administrator

Games may re-enable services automatically on launch

Use the full guide for manual removal (registry, file deletion, etc.) if needed

Navigate to:

C:\Windows\System32\drivers\

Find and delete:

[DriverFileName].sys

4. Remove Installation Folder

Delete any remaining folders in:

C:\Program Files\ or C:\Program Files (x86)\

5. Clean the Registry

Open regedit and remove:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\[ServiceName]

6. Remove Driver Package (Optional)

pnputil /enum-drivers

Find the associated oemXX.inf, then remove it:

pnputil /delete-driver oemXX.inf /uninstall /force

üõ°Ô∏è Known Anti-Cheat Kernel Driver Removal Commands

[...driver sections remain unchanged...]

üí° Universal Kill Switch (Temporary Disable All)

This script stops all known anti-cheat services in one go:

# PowerShell Universal Anti-Cheat Stop Script
$services = @(
  "vgk", "vgc", "EasyAntiCheat", "BEService", "atvi-brynhildr",
  "FACEIT", "xhunter1", "npggsvc"
)
foreach ($svc in $services) {
    Write-Host "Stopping $svc..."
    sc.exe stop $svc 2>$null
}

Note: This is a temporary disable. All drivers/services may restart on reboot or when launching their respective games.

üîç Quick Scan Script: Check What‚Äôs Running

Use this script to scan and report which known anti-cheat services are currently running:

# PowerShell Anti-Cheat Status Scanner
$services = @(
  "vgk", "vgc", "EasyAntiCheat", "BEService", "atvi-brynhildr",
  "FACEIT", "xhunter1", "npggsvc"
)
foreach ($svc in $services) {
    $status = Get-Service -Name $svc -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
    if ($status -and $status.Status -eq 'Running') {
        Write-Host "$svc is RUNNING" -ForegroundColor Red
    } elseif ($status) {
        Write-Host "$svc is installed but NOT running" -ForegroundColor Yellow
    } else {
        Write-Host "$svc is NOT installed" -ForegroundColor Green
    }
}

üîí Disable Services on Startup (Optional Script)

Use this script to force-disable all known anti-cheat services from starting on boot:

# PowerShell Anti-Cheat Service Disabler
$services = @(
  "vgk", "vgc", "EasyAntiCheat", "BEService", "atvi-brynhildr",
  "FACEIT", "xhunter1", "npggsvc"
)
foreach ($svc in $services) {
    Write-Host "Disabling $svc startup..."
    Set-Service -Name $svc -StartupType Disabled -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
}

This will prevent the services from starting unless manually re-enabled or reinstalled by a game client.

üîç How to Verify Removal

Check if the Service Still Exists

sc query type= driver state= all | findstr /I "vgc vgk EasyAntiCheat BEService atvi-brynhildr FACEIT xhunter1 npggsvc"

Check for Active Drivers

driverquery /v | findstr /I "vgk EasyAntiCheat BEDaisy atvi-brynhildr faceit xhunter1 npggsvc"

üõ†Ô∏è Additional Tools (Recommended)

Autoruns: Shows startup services and drivers

Driver Store Explorer (RAPR): Helps remove orphaned .inf driver packages

Sysinternals Process Explorer: Shows what‚Äôs actually running at the system level
