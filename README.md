## 🎯 What This Is

Many popular games today install anti-cheat systems that run at **kernel level** (aka Ring 0)—the deepest layer of your operating system. These services:

* Often **do not uninstall** with the game
* May run **constantly in the background**
* Have **admin-level access** to your system

This project provides:

* 🔧 PowerShell scripts to detect, stop, and disable known anti-cheat systems
* 📖 Educational content explaining what kernel-level anti-cheat is and why it matters
* 💡 Guidance for everyday users and privacy-conscious gamers alike
